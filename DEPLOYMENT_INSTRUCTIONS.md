# How to Deploy This Project

This project is hosted in Firebase Studio, a cloud-based development environment. You **do not** need to use the `firebase` command-line tool (CLI) on your local computer to deploy it.

Deployment for this Next.js application is handled directly through the **Firebase Console website**.

## Correct Deployment Steps

1.  **Go to the Firebase Console:** [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2.  **Select your `MeroSathi` project.**
3.  In the left-hand menu, under the "Build" section, click on **App Hosting**.
4.  On the App Hosting page, you should see your backend listed. If not, follow the prompts to create one.
5.  Follow the on-screen instructions to **connect your GitHub repository**. Since you've already authorized GitHub, this should be a quick process.
6.  Select your `SanjayNewar7/MeroSathiWeb` repository from the list.
7.  Select the `main` branch to deploy from.
8.  Once you confirm, Firebase will automatically start building and deploying your app.

You can monitor the progress directly on the App Hosting page. After the first deployment is complete, every new push to your `main` branch on GitHub will automatically trigger a new deployment.
