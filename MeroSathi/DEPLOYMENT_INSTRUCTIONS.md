# How to Deploy This Project

This project is hosted in Firebase Studio, a cloud-based development environment. You **do not** need to use the `firebase` command-line tool (CLI) on your local computer to deploy it.

Deployment for this Next.js application is handled directly through the **Firebase Console website**.

## Correct Deployment Steps

1.  **Go to the Firebase Console:** [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2.  **Select your `MeroSathi` project.**
3.  In the left-hand menu, under the "Build" section, click on **App Hosting**.
4.  **Create the Backend:** Since this is your first time, the page will be empty. Click the **"Create backend"** or **"Get Started"** button. This is the crucial first step to tell Firebase you want to set up an app here.
5.  **Connect GitHub:** Follow the on-screen instructions to **connect your GitHub repository**. Since you've already authorized GitHub, this should be a quick process.
6.  **Select Repository and Branch:**
    *   Choose your `SanjayNewar7/MeroSathiWeb` repository from the list.
    *   Select the `main` branch to deploy from.
7.  **Confirm and Deploy:** Once you confirm, Firebase will automatically start building and deploying your app.

You can monitor the progress directly on the App Hosting page. After the first deployment is complete, every new push to your `main` branch on GitHub will automatically trigger a new deployment.
